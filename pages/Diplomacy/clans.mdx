## Clans

If you wish to ally together with a group of friends, you may form a Clan. Being in a clan offers several advantages; however, there are also downsides.

Clan members automatically deploy 10% of their troops for the sole purpose of defending other clan members - in doing so, clan members can significantly boost their defensive power against attacking empires. Beware - an enemy engaging in a Surprise Attack will be able to bypass these extra defenses, including the 10% you shared yourself!

Clan members can see the combined news feeds, intel and stats of all empires in the clan as well as chat among themselves.

However, being in a clan also opens the possibility of war, allowing members of enemy clans to attack you mercilessly (and also allowing your clan to do the same). War can be declared by another clan at any time. While at war you will be subject to a war tax. To end a war both clans must accept the peace offering.

### Creating and Joining

When you wish to create a clan, simply enter a short name and specify a password which other players must enter in order to join.

If you wish to join a clan which has already been created and you have been given its password, simply select the clan from the dropdown list and enter the password in the space provided.
