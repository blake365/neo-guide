## Intel Center

This section allows you to see and acquire information on other empires to find out their strengths and weaknesses.

To get intel on other empires your wizards will cast Crystal Ball on another empire. To succeed you will need a ratio of 1x your opponent.

- **Crystal Ball**  
  If successful, this will allow you to see the vital statistics of your target's empire, just as is shown on your [Summary Page](/Information/empire-summary).

Once you've gathered some intel, you can view them in the Intel Center. The most recent intel will be on the top of the list. It is risky to rely on outdated intel.
