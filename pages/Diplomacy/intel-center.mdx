## Intel Center

This section allows you to see and acquire information on other empires to find out their strengths and weaknesses.

To get intel on other empires your wizards will cast Crystal Ball on another empire. To succeed you will need a ratio of 1x your opponent.

To determine the ratio you can use the following formulas:

Your magic offense power is: `your wizards / ((your land + enemy land ) / 2) * race magic bonus`

Enemy magic defense power is: `enemy wizards / enemy land * 1.05 * enemy race magic bonus`

Magic ratio: `your magic offense / enemy magic defense`

- **Crystal Ball**  
  If successful, this will allow you to see the vital statistics of your target's empire, just as is shown on your [Summary Page](/Information/empire-summary).

Once you've gathered some intel, you can view them in the Intel Center. The most recent intel will be on the top of the list. It is risky to rely on outdated intel.
