## Sending Foreign Aid

If one of your friends or clan mates is in trouble and needs help, you can send some of your galleons with a shipment of troops and supplies. Up to {AID_MAXCREDITS} can be sent at any given time, and one additional shipment can be sent every {AID_DELAY / 60 / 60} hours.

In a single aid shipment, you can send up to 15% of your empire's currently available troops, money, mana, and food to another empire.

No matter what you wish to send, you must send a minimum number of galleons to deliver your shipment, where the amount is based on the size of your empire.

Aid can only be sent to those who actually need it - an empire whose net worth is significantly greater than yours likely has no need for your goods. However, if you are in a clan, you will be allowed to send goods to clan mates many times your size.

It is not possible to send aid to those you are at war with.
