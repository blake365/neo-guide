## Your Army

From here, you may deploy your empire's military to attack other empires and steal their land and resources. Once your empire reaches a certain size, this becomes the easiest method of expansion.

In order to attack another empire, it must either be in the same era as yours or a Time Gate must be open between your empires, either opened by you or by your target.

Six different attack methods are available for you to use, each having their own advantages and disadvantages:

- **Standard Attack**  
  The standard attack type, this allows sending all types of military units to attack your target. If successful, you will steal a percentage of your target's land, potentially with some of its original structures intact.

- **Surprise Attack**  
  A surprise attack grants a 25% attack power bonus and allows the attacker to bypass any shared forces the defender's clan may have, though this comes at the cost of increased troop losses for the attacker as well as a significantly higher health loss. If successful, all structures on captured land are destroyed.

- **Guerilla Strike**  
  By sending in only your footmen, you can avoid your target's other forces. If successful, all structures on captured land are destroyed.

- **Lay Siege**  
  By sending in only your catapults, you can not only steal your target's land but also destroy additional structures on the land you do not capture. Guard towers and mage towers are especially vulnerable.

- **Air Strike**  
  By sending in only your zeppelins, you can not only steal your target's land but also destroy additional structures on the land you do not capture. While attacking from above, significantly more structures can be destroyed, but much fewer will be captured.

- **Coastal Assault**  
  By sending in only your galleons, you can not only steal your target's land but also destroy additional structures on the land you do not capture. Guard towers and mage towers are especially vulnerable.

- **Pillage**  
  Send your whole army on a raid for food and cash. If you are successful you will capture a small amount of land as well as steal food and cash from your enemy.

## Casting Spells

From here, your wizards can spend mana and turns to cast spells on your enemies.

Spells cannot be cast if your empire's health is below 20%. Casting an offensive spell reduces health by 6%.

If your empire's magic power is not great enough, high level spells will result in a magical explosion and kill some of your wizards.

To successfully cast an offensive spell, your magic ratio must be a certain value.

Your magic offense power is: `your wizards / ((your land + enemy land ) / 2) * race magic bonus`

Enemy magic defense power is: `enemy wizards / enemy land * 1.05 * enemy race magic bonus`

Magic ratio: `your magic offense / enemy magic defense`

### Offensive Spells

- **Fireball**  
  If successful, this will eliminate 3% of your enemy's military and magical forces. If your target has an active spell shield, only 1% will be destroyed.

- **Storms**  
  If successful, this will destroy a percentage of your target's cash and food. If shielded, it will only be 33% as effective.

- **Lightning Strike**  
  If successful, this will destroy a percentage of your target's mana, limiting the ability of their wizards to cast spells. If shielded, it will only be 33% as effective.

- **Wrath of Demons**  
  If successful, this will destroy 3% of your enemy's structures. If your target has an active spell shield, only 1% will be destroyed.

- **Magic User Fight**  
  This spell will allow your wizards to battle with your target's magic users. Successful attacks will steal approximately 33% as much land as a standard military attack.

- **Embezzlement**  
  If successful, this will allow you to steal cash from your target empire's treasury. If shielded, it will only be 33% as effective.
