## Mage Strategy

As a Mage, your primary goal is to produce cash through magical spells.

### Set up

The best [races](/Getting-Started/races) for a Mage strategy are Elf, Drow, and Pixie due to their magic and Mana production bonus. Mages are also best suited for the [past era](/Getting-Started/eras) due to the 20% increase to Mana production. Players do not need to advance eras as a Mage.

Mages need to focus on one main building: Mage Towers. Mage Towers produce Mana and bring Wizards to your empire. You may also want to build some Farms because Wizards like to eat a lot.

### Using Turns

In order to produce the most Mana and resources as possible, you will need a lot of land. Start your session with full turns (400). Use your initial turns attacking other players. As a mage you will be in a strong position to gain intel and use magical attacks. Your health will drop as you attack. When your health is less than 70% or you fail an attack, it is time to stop and build. Build Mage Towers so that they make up around 95% of your buildings. After you build, [meditate](/Using-Turns/meditate) to create more Mana until you are back to 100% health. Repeat this process until you are out of attacks.

Now that you have a lot of land and Wizards, focus some of your turns producing more Mana. When you have enough Mana, go to the [Magic Center](/Using-Turns/magic-center) and cast Tree of Gold as many times as you can. If you run low on food you can buy some from the markets or cast Cornucopia to make some yourself.

Take cash you just made and spend it on the [public market](/Finance/public-market) or [black market](/Finance/black-market). You will likely want to buy food and troops so compare prices to get the best deal.
