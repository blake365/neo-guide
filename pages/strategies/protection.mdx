## Your First Turns in Protection

Your empire is protected until you have used 400 turns. You cannot attack nor be attacked during this time. Other game functions are limited as well.

The first order of business should be expanding your lands by [exploring](/Using-Turns/explore). Once you have some land to work with, you need to [build structures](/Getting-Started/structures). The optimum structures will depend on your race and strategy choices. Finding your niche within the game is essential for having the most success. For example, if you notice a lack of food on the [Public Market](/Finance/public-market), farming could be a good choice.

It is recommended that every empire build some amount of Mage Towers in order to advance between eras and [cast spell shields](/Using-Turns/magic-center) for protection against Mages.

Once you have used 399 turns, it is best to wait until you have 400 turns again before breaking out of protection. Going forward it is recommended that you have full turns and use as many turns as possible in one session. When you are out of protection, you will be vulnerable to [attacks](/Diplomacy/war-council) from other players. On the other hand, you should be ready to launch your first attacks as soon as you can. Attacking is a much faster way to gain land than exploring. It can be beneficial to select one or two troop types to focus on in your army. [Military units](/Getting-Started/military) have different attack and defense capabilities in each [era](/Getting-Started/eras) so find the one that works for you.
