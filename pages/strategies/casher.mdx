## Casher Strategy

As a casher, your primary goal is to produce cash for yourself. You will rely on other players to purchase food and troops from them on the markets.

### Set up

The best [races](/Getting-Started/races) for a casher strategy are Gnome, Minotaur and Vampire due to their lower troop upkeep, higher per capita income, and market bonus. Cashers are also best suited for the [future era](/Getting-Started/eras) due to the 15% increase in income. Players should aim to advance to this era as soon as possible.

Cashers need to focus on a few building types: Huts, Markets, Keeps and Mage Towers. Huts brings more peasants to your empire increasing your population. Markets produce income and increase your per capita income. Keeps reduce the upkeep cost of troops and reduce the prices on the [black market](/Finance/black-market). Mage Towers are needed in small quantities to advance eras and protect yourself from magical attacks with Spell Shield.

### Using Turns

In order to produce the most cash you can, you will need a lot of land. Start your session when you have full turns ({TURNS_MAXIMUM}). Use your initial turns attacking other players. Your health will drop as you attack. When your health is less than 70% or you fail an attack, it is time to stop and build. Build Huts and Markets so that they make up around 45% of your buildings each. After you build, [cash](/Using-Turns/cash) until you are back to 100% health. Repeat this process until you are out of attacks. During this time it can be beneficial to lower your tax rate to encourage peasants to come to your empire.

Now that you have a lot of land, Huts, Markets, and peasants, focus the rest of your time producing cash. During this time it can be good to raise your tax rate, just remember it will cause some of your peasants to leave. Don't forget to cast a spell shield before you run out of turns.

Take cash you just made and spend it on the [public market](/Finance/public-market) or [black market](/Finance/black-market). You will likely want to buy food and troops so compare prices to get the best deal.

If you return to find yourself attacked and with much less land, don't fear. Your population will drop but it can recover as you gain back the land you lost. Be prepared to be in the red for a while until you recover.
