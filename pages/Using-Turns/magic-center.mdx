## Casting Spells

From here, your wizards can spend mana and turns to cast spells on your own empire.

Spells cannot be cast if your empire's health is below 20%.

If your empire's magic power is not great enough, high level spells will result in a magical explosion and kill some of your wizards.

### Utility Spells

- **Spell Shield**  
  This will allow you to partially protect your empire from magical attacks from other empires. Casting once will protect your empire for 24 hours, and each additional cast will extend it by 3 hours. If your empire has less than 14 hours of protection remaining, it will automatically be renewed to 24 hours.

- **Cornucopia**  
  This spell will create an amount of food to feed your citizens and army, the amount being proportional to the size of your empire and the number of wizards at your disposal.

- **Tree of Gold**  
  This spell will create cash to fund your empire, the amount being proportional to the size of your empire and the number of wizards at your disposal.

- **Open Time Gate**  
  This spell will open a Time Gate, allowing your empire to attack other empires in any time period. Casting once will open the gate for 12 hours, and each additional cast will extend it by 3 hours. If your empire's gate has less than 9 hours remaining, it will automatically be renewed to 12 hours.

- **Close Time Gate**  
  If your empire currently has an open Time Gate, this spell will close it, protecting your empire from attacks by other empires in different time periods (unless they themselves have open time gates).

- **Advance Era**  
  This spell advances your empire from its current era to the next one (if such an era exists). At least 72 hours must be spent in your current era before you may cast this spell.

- **Regress Era**  
  This spell regresses your empire from its current era to the previous one (if such an era exists). At least 72 hours must be spent in your current era before you may cast this spell.
