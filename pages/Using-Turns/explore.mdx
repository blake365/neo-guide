## Exploration

For small empires, attacking others to gain land is infeasible - their time is better spent exploring.

While spending turns here, your empire will expand its borders and gain additional land.

Be warned - as your empire grows larger, it will become more and more difficult to find usable land, at which point you will have to resort to [attacking](/diplomacy/war-council) other empires to steal their land.
