## Construction

Without buildings, organization is impossible - from here, you may spend time and money building structures to strengthen your empire.

As the size of your empire increases you will be able to build structures more quickly, but the cost of building will also increase due to the difficulty of transporting materials.

For a description of what each building does, see [Structures](/Getting-Started/structures).
