For all of the above values, a positive percentage works to your empire's advantage while a negative percentage acts as a penalty. For attributes noted with a "*", this may seem backwards - for example, a food consumption penalty (negative) will *increase* how much food your units require, while an upkeep bonus (positive) will *decrease\* your expenses.
