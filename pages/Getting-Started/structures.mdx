## Structures

Your empire's land can be allocated for the following purposes:

### Huts

While peasants will live on unused land, these are specifically designed for housing. As a result, they allow you to house a great deal more peasants than otherwise.

### Markets

These allow your empire's economy to grow, helping to increase your Per Capita Income, as well as directly producing money themselves.

### Blacksmiths

These produce your military units; the percentage of resources allocated to each unit type produced is controlled through the industry settings on the industrial focus page.

### Keeps

These allow you to reduce your military expenses by more efficiently housing your units. They will also lower the price of all military units purchased from the Private Market. These also increase the rate at which your Private Market refills.

### Mage Towers

These serve to train and house wizards, as well as produce mana with which they may cast their spells.

### Farms

These are vital for feeding your peasants and military; without food, your population and army will starve and desert your empire.

### Guard Towers

These are a strictly defensive building, for every 1% of land built as Guard, your defense is increased by 1% (up to 50%) and your diminishing returns (DR) rate increases by 0.01.
