## Eras

Empires in this world exist in 3 different time periods. Interacting directly with an empire in another era requires an open Time Gate.

The offensive and defensive power of [military units](/Getting-Started/military-units) varies with one's era. Additionally, empires in different eras receive the following bonuses and penalties:

- **Economy**: Affects the per capita income of your citizens.
- **Food Production**: Affects how productive your farms are.
- **Industry**: Affects your ability to produce military units.
- **Energy**: The rate at which your wizards produce mana.
- **Exploration**: How much land you gain per turn spent [exploring](/explore).

| Era     | Economy | Food Production | Industry | Energy | Exploration |
| ------- | ------- | --------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Past    | -5%     | -5%             | -10%     | 20%    | 0%          |
| Present | 0%      | 15%             | 5%       | 0%     | 20%         |
| Future  | 15%     | -5%             | 15%      | -20%   | 40%         |

## Time Gates

Time Gates are the only way to interact with empires in other eras. They are opened by wizards in the [magic center](/magic-center) and require a large amount of mana to maintain. Time Gates can be opened or closed at any time, but the process takes 2 turns.

## Era Differences

On top of the era bonuses above, the names of resources, [structures](/Getting-Started/structures), and [units](/Getting-Started/military-units) change between eras.

| Past     | Present   | Future      |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Peasants | Civilians | Drones      |
| Grains   | Nutrients | Power Cells |
| Mana     | Energy    | Bandwidth   |
