## Empire Settings

Here you can update your public profile and set an icon. Your profile is a way to describe your empire, play style, or just be silly. Your icon is another way to express your personality in the game. Both are visible on the scores page.

### Polymorph

Change the [race](/Getting-Started/races) of your empire's inhabitants to change your empire's bonuses. During protection you can change your race for no cost. After protection it will cost you 200 turns, 25% of your food, cash, and runes, and 10% of your population and army.

### Delete Empire

If you no longer wish to play, you can delete your empire. Please take a moment to let us know why you have decided to delete. This will remove your empire from the game. You will not be able to recover your empire once it is deleted but you can create a new empire on your account.
