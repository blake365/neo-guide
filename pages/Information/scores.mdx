## Scores List

This page lists the empires in the game. A pulsing blue dot indicates that a player is currently or was recently online. It is best to not interrupt players as they are using their turns so as not to spark a damaging conflict.

  Your own empire is always displayed in this color, making it easier to locate yourself in the score list.

Each empire is listed in the table with the following statistics displayed:

- **Rank**  
  The empire's rank (based on net worth), compared to all other empires in the game.
- **Empire**  
  The empire's icon and name.
- **Net Worth**  
  A calculated number indicating the empire's overall value.
- **Land**  
  The total amount of land the empire occupies.
- **Era**  
  The time period in which the empire exists.
- **Race**  
  The race of the empire's inhabitants.
- **DR**  
  The empire's current diminishing returns value. As an empire is attacked, their DR percentage increases which causes them to lose less land each successive attack. The rate of increase is affected by building guard towers.
